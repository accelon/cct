1 說卦:	
昔者聖人之作《易》也，幽贊於神明而生蓍，參天兩地而倚數，觀變於陰陽而立卦，發揮於剛柔而生爻，和順於道德而理於義，窮理盡性以至於命。
Shuo Gua:	
Anciently, when the sages made the Yi, in order to give mysterious assistance to the spiritual Intelligences, they produced (the rules for the use of) the divining plant. The number 3 was assigned to heaven, 2 to earth, and from these came the (other) numbers. They contemplated the changes in the divided and undivided lines (by the process of manipulating the stalks), and formed the trigrams; from the movements that took place in the strong and weak lines, they produced (their teaching about) the separate lines. There ensued a harmonious conformity to the course (of duty) and to virtue, with a discrimination of what was right (in each particular case). They (thus) made an exhaustive discrimination of what was right, and effected the complete development of (every) nature, till they arrived (in the Yi) at what was appointed for it (by Heaven).
2 說卦:	
昔者聖人之作《易》也，將以順性命之理，是以立天之道曰陰與陽，立地之道曰柔與剛，立人之道曰仁與義。兼三才而兩之，故《易》六畫而成卦。分陰分陽，迭用柔剛，故《易》六位而成章。
Shuo Gua:	
Anciently, when the sages made the Yi, it was with the design that (its figures) should be in conformity with the principles underlying the natures (of men and things), and the ordinances (for them) appointed (by Heaven). With this view they exhibited (in them) the way of heaven, calling (the lines) yin and yang; the way of earth, calling (them) the weak (or soft) and the strong (or hard); and the way of men, under the names of benevolence and righteousness. Each (trigram) embraced (those) three Powers; and, being repeated, its full form consisted of six lines. A distinction was made of (the places assigned) to the yin and yang lines, which were variously occupied, now by the strong and now by the weak forms, and thus the figure (of each hexagram) was completed.
3 說卦:	g
天地定位，山澤通氣，雷風相薄，水火不相射，八卦相錯。數往者順，知來者逆，是故《易》逆數也。
Shuo Gua:	
(The symbols of) heaven and earth received their determinate positions; (those for) mountains and collections of water interchanged their influences; (those for) thunder and wind excited each other the more; and (those for) water and fire did each other no harm. (Then) among these eight symbols there was a mutual communication. The numbering of the past is a natural process.; the knowledge of the coming is anticipation. Therefore in the Yi we have (both) anticipation (and the natural process).
4 說卦:	
雷以動之，風以散之，雨以潤之，日以烜之，艮以止之，兌以說之，乾以君之，坤以藏之。
Shuo Gua:	
Thunder serves to put things in motion; wind to scatter (the genial seeds of) them; rain to moisten them; the sun to warm them; (what is symbolised by) Zhen, to arrest (and keep them in their places); (by) Dui, to give them joyful course; (by) Qian, to rule them; and by Kun, to store them up.
5 說卦:	
帝出乎震，齊乎巽，相見乎離，致役乎坤，說言乎兌，戰乎乾，勞乎坎，成言乎艮。萬物出乎震，震東方也。齊乎巽，巽東南也，齊也者、言萬物之絜齊也。離也者、明也，萬物皆相見，南方之卦也。聖人南面而聽天下，嚮明而治，蓋取諸此也。坤也者、地也，萬物皆致養焉，故曰：致役乎坤。兌、正秋也，萬物之所說也，故曰：說言乎兌。戰乎乾，乾、西北之卦也，言陰陽相薄也。坎者、水也，正北方之卦也，勞卦也，萬物之所歸也，故曰：勞乎坎。艮、東北之卦也。萬物之所成終而所成始也。故曰：成言乎艮。
Shuo Gua:	
God comes forth in Zhen (to His producing work); He brings (His processes) into full and equal action in Xun; they are manifested to one another in Li; the greatest service is done for Him in Kun; He rejoices in Dui; He struggles in Qian; He is comforted and enters into rest in Kan; and He completes (the work of the year) in Zhen. All things are made to issue forth in Zhen, which is placed at the east. (The processes of production) are brought into full and equal action in Xun, which is placed at the south-east. The being brought into full and equal action refers to the purity and equal arrangement of all things. Li gives the idea of brightness. All things are now made manifest to one another. It is the trigram of the south. The sages turn their faces to the south when they give audience to all under the sky, administering government towards the region of brightness:--the idea in this procedure was taken from this. Kun denotes the earth, (and is placed at the south-west). All things receive from it their fullest nourishment, and hence it is said, 'The greatest service is done for Him in Kun.' Dui corresponds (to the west) and to the autumn,--the season in which all things rejoice. Hence it is said, 'He rejoices in Dui.' He struggles in Qian, which is the trigram of the north-west. The idea is that there the inactive and active conditions beat against each other. Kan denotes water. It is the trigram of the exact north,--the trigram of comfort and rest, what all things are tending to. Hence it is said, 'He is comforted and enters into rest in Kan. Zhen is the trigram of the north-east. In it all things bring to a full end the issues of the past (year), and prepare the commencement of the next. Hence it is said, 'He completes (the work of the year) in Zhen.'
6 說卦:	
神也者、妙萬物而為言者也。動萬物者莫疾乎雷，橈萬物者莫疾乎風，燥萬物者莫熯乎火，說萬物者莫說乎澤，潤萬物者莫潤乎水，終萬物、始萬物者、莫盛乎艮。故水火相逮，雷風不相悖，山澤通氣，然後能變化，既成萬物也。
Shuo Gua:	
When we speak of Spirit we mean the subtle (presence and operation of God) with all things. For putting all things in motion there is nothing more vehement than thunder; for scattering them there is nothing more effective than wind; for drying them up there is nothing more parching than fire; for giving them pleasure and satisfaction there is nothing more grateful than a lake or marsh; for moistening them there is nothing more enriching than water; for bringing them to an end and making them begin again there is nothing more fully adapted than Zhen. Thus water and fire contribute together to the one object; thunder and wind do not act contrary to each other; mountains and collections of water interchange their influences. It is in this way, that they are able to change and transform, and to give completion to all things.
