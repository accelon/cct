1 ䷀乾:	
乾：元亨，利貞。
Qian:	
Qian (represents) what is great and originating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and firm.
彖傳:	
大哉乾元，萬物資始，乃統天。雲行雨施，品物流形。大明始終，六位時成，時乘六龍以御天。乾道變化，各正性命，保合大和，乃利貞。首出庶物，萬國咸寧。
Tuan Zhuan:	
Vast is the 'great and originating (power)' indicated by Qian! All things owe to it their beginning: - it contains all the meaning belonging to (the name) heaven. The clouds move and the rain is distributed; the various things appear in their developed forms. (The sages) grandly understand (the connexion between) the end and the beginning, and how (the indications of) the six lines (in the hexagram) are accomplished, (each) in its season. (Accordingly) they mount (the carriage) drawn by those six dragons at the proper times, and drive through the sky. The method of Qian is to change and transform, so that everything obtains its correct nature as appointed (by the mind of Heaven); and (thereafter the conditions of) great harmony are preserved in union. The result is 'what is advantageous, and correct and firm. (The sage) appears aloft, high above all things, and the myriad states all enjoy repose.
象傳:	
天行健，君子以自強不息。

In the first (or lowest) NINE, undivided, (we see its subject as) the dragon lying hid (in the deep). It is not the time for active doing.
象傳:	
潛龍勿用，陽在下也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'The dragon lies hid in the deep; - it is not the time for active doing:' - (this appears from) the strong and undivided line's being in the lowest place.
3 ䷀乾:	
九二：見龍在田，利見大人。
Qian:	
In the second NINE, undivided, (we see its subject as) the dragon appearing in the field. It will be advantageous to meet with the great man.
象傳:

Xiang Zhuan:	
'The dragon appears in the field:' - the diffusion of virtuous influence has been wide.
4 ䷀乾:	
九三：君子終日乾乾，夕惕若，厲，无咎。
Qian:	
In the third NINE, undivided, (we see its subject as) the superior man active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening still careful and apprehensive. (The position is) dangerous, but there will be no mistake.
象傳:	
終日乾乾，反復道也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'Active and vigilant all the day:' - (this refers to) the treading of the (proper) path over and over again.
5 ䷀乾:	
九四：或躍在淵，无咎。
Qian:	
In the fourth NINE, undivided, (we see its subject as the dragon looking) as if he were leaping up, but still in the deep. There will be no mistake.
象傳:	
或躍在淵，進无咎也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'He seems to be leaping up, but is still in the deep:' - if he advance, there will be no error.
6 ䷀乾:	
九五：飛龍在天，利見大人。
Qian:	
In the fifth NINE, undivided, (we see its subject as) the dragon on the wing in the sky. It will be advantageous to meet with the great man.
象傳:	
飛龍在天，大人造也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'The dragon is on the wing in the sky:' - the great man rouses himself to his work.
7 ䷀乾:	
上九：亢龍有悔。
Qian:	
In the sixth (or topmost) NINE, undivided, (we see its subject as) the dragon exceeding the proper limits. There will be occasion for repentance.
象傳:	
亢龍有悔，盈不可久也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'The dragon exceeds the proper limits; - there will be occasion for repentance:' - a state of fulness, that is, should not be indulged in long.
8 ䷀乾:	
用九：見群龍无首，吉。
Qian:	
(The lines of this hexagram are all strong and undivided, as appears from) the use of the number NINE. If the host of dragons (thus) appearing were to divest themselves of their heads, there would be good fortune.
象傳:	
用九，天德不可為首也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'The same NINE (undivided) is used' (in all the places of this hexagram), but the attribute of heaven (thereby denoted) should not (always) take the foremost place.
9 文言:	
《文言》曰：「元」者，善之長也；「亨」者，嘉之會也；「利」者，義之和也；「貞」者，事之幹也。君子體仁足以長人，嘉會足以合禮，利物足以和義，貞固足以幹事。君子行此四德者，故曰「乾、元、亨、利、貞」。
Qian:	
What is called (under Qian) 'the great and originating' is (in man) the first and chief quality of goodness; what is called 'the penetrating' is the assemblage of excellences; what is called 'the advantageous' is the harmony of all that is right; and what is called 'the correct and firm' is the faculty of action. The superior man, embodying benevolence, is fit to preside over men; presenting the assemblage of excellences, he is fit to show in himself the union of all propriety; benefiting (all) creatures, he is fit to exhibit the harmony of all that is right; correct and firm, he is fit to manage (all) affairs. The fact that the superior man practises these four virtues justifies the application to him of the words - 'Qian represents what is great and originating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and firm.'
10 文言:	
初九曰、「潛龍勿用」，何謂也？子曰：「龍、德而隱者也。不易乎世，不成乎名，遯世无悶，不見是而无悶。樂則行之，憂則違之，確乎其不可拔，潛龍也。」
Qian:	
What is the meaning of the words under the first NINE, (undivided), 'The dragon lies hid (in the deep) - it is not the time for active doing?' The Master said: There he is, with the powers of the dragon, and yet lying hid. The influence of the world would make no change in him; he would do nothing (merely) to secure his fame. He can live, withdrawn from the world, without regret; he can experience disapproval without trouble of mind. Rejoicing (in opportunity), he carries his principles into action; sorrowing (for want of opportunity), he keeps with them in retirement. Yes, he is not to be torn from his root (in himself).' This is 'the dragon lying hid.'
11 文言:	
九二曰：「見龍在田，利見大人」，何謂也？子曰：「龍德而正中者也。庸言之信，庸行之謹，閑邪存其誠，善世而不伐，德博而化。《易》曰：『見龍在田，利見大人』，君德也。」
Qian:	
What is the meaning of the words under the second NINE, 'The dragon shows himself and is in the field - it will be advantageous to see the great man?' The Master said: 'There he is, with the dragon's powers, and occupying exactly the central place. He is sincere (even) in his ordinary words, and earnest in his ordinary conduct. Guarding against depravity, he preserves his sincerity. His goodness is recognised in the world, but he does not boast of it. His virtue is extensively displayed, and transformation ensues. The language of the Yi, "The dragon shows himself and is in the field - it will be advantageous to see the great man." refers to a ruler's virtue.'
12 文言:	
九三曰：「君子終日乾乾、夕惕若、厲、无咎」。何謂也？子曰：「君子進德脩業，忠信，所以進德也，脩辭立其誠，所以居業也。知至至之，可與幾也，知終終之，可與存義也。是故居上位而不驕，在下位而不憂，故乾乾因其時而惕，雖危无咎矣。」
Qian:	
What is the meaning of the words under the third NINE,' The superior man is active and vigilant all the day, and in the evening (still) careful and apprehensive - the position is dangerous, but there will be no mistake?' The Master said: 'The superior man advances in virtue, and cultivates all the sphere of his duty. His leal-heartedness and good faith are the way by which he advances in virtue. His attention to his words and establishing his sincerity are the way by which he occupies in his sphere. He knows the utmost point to be reached, and reaches it, thus showing himself in accord with the first springs (of things); he knows the end to be rested in, and rests in it, thus preserving his righteousness in accordance with that end. Therefore he occupies a high position without pride, and a low position without anxiety. Thus it is that, being active and vigilant, and careful (also) and apprehensive as the time requires, though his position be perilous, he will make no mistake.'
13 文言:	
九四曰：「或躍在淵，无咎。」何謂也？子曰：「上下无常，非為邪也。進退无恆，非離群也。君子進德脩業，欲及時也，故无咎。」
Qian:	
What is the meaning of the words under the fourth NINE, 'He is as if he were leaping up, (but still) is in the deep - there will be no mistake?' The Master said: 'He finds no permanent place either above or below, but he does not commit the error (of advancing). He may advance or recede - there is no permanent place for him: but he does not leave his fellows. The superior man, advancing in virtue and cultivating the sphere of his duty, yet wishes (to advance only) at the (proper) time, and therefore there is no mistake.'
14 文言:	
九五曰：「飛龍在天，利見大人」。何謂也？子曰：「同聲相應，同氣相求。水流濕，火就燥，雲從龍，風從虎，聖人作而萬物覩。本乎天者親上，本乎地者親下，則各從其類也。」
Qian:	
What is the meaning of the words under the fifth NINE, 'The dragon is on the wing in the sky - it will be advantageous to see the great man?' The Master said: 'Notes of the same key respond to one another; creatures of the same nature seek one another; water flows towards the place that is (low and) damp; fire rises up towards what is dry; clouds follow the dragon, and winds follow the tiger:(so) the sage makes his appearance, and all men look to him. Things that draw their origin from heaven move towards what is above; things that draw their origin from the earth cleave to what is below:--so does everything follow its kind.'
15 文言:	
上九曰：「亢龍有悔」，何謂也？子曰：「貴而无位，高而无民，賢人在下位而无輔，是以動而有悔也。」
Qian:	
What is the meaning of the words under the topmost NINE, 'The dragon exceeds the proper limits - there will be occasion for repentance?' The Master said: 'The position is noble, but it is not that of office; (its occupant) dwells on high, but he has no people (to rule); and the men of talent and virtue in the positions below will give him no aid - should he move in such a case, there will be occasion for repentance.'
16 文言:	
「潛龍勿用」，下也；「見龍在田」，時舍也；「終日乾乾」，行事也；「或躍在淵」，自試也；「飛龍在天」，上治也；「亢龍有悔」、窮之災也。乾元「用九」，天下治也。
Qian:	
'The dragon lies hid - it is not the time for active doing:'--the position is (too) low.
'The dragon shows himself and is in the field:'--the time (requires him still) to be unemployed.
'All the day active and vigilant:'--(he now) does his (proper) business.
'He is as if he were leaping up, (but still) is in the deep:'--he is making trial of himself.
'The dragon is on the wing in the sky:'--(the subject of the line) is on high and ruling.
'The dragon exceeds the proper limit, and there will be occasion for repentance:'--when things have been carried to extremity, calamity ensues.
Undivided lines appear in all these representations of the great and originating power denoted by Qian:--(what follows in the Yao tells us how) all under the sky there will be good order.
17 文言:	
「潛龍勿用」，陽氣潛藏。「見龍在田」，天下文明。「終日乾乾」，與時偕行。「或躍在淵」，乾道乃革。「飛龍在天」，乃位乎天德。「亢龍有悔」，與時偕極。乾元「用九」，乃見天則。
Qian:	
'The dragon lies hid in the deep - it is not the time for active doing:'--the energy denoted by the undivided line is laid up and hid away as in the deep.
'The dragon appears in the field:'--all under heaven (begins to be) adorned and brightened.
'All the day active and vigilant:'--continually, as the time passes and requires, does he act.
'He is as if he were leaping up, (but still) is in the deep:'--a change is taking place in the method indicated by (this) Qian diagram.
'The dragon is on the wing in the sky this shows that his place is based on his heavenly virtue.
'The dragon exceeds the (proper) limit - there will be occasion for repentance:'--the time is come to an end, and so also is his opportunity.
Undivided NINES appear in all these representations of the great and originating power denoted by Qian:--and (from what follows in the Yao) we see the model (of action) afforded by heaven.
18 文言:	
《乾》「元」者，始而亨者也。「利貞」者，性情也。乾始能以美利利天下，不言所利，大矣哉！
Qian:	
The 'greatness' and 'originating' represented by Qian refer to it as (the symbol of) what gives their beginning (to all things), and (also) secures their growth and development.
'The advantageousness and the correctness and firmness' refer to its nature and feelings (as seen in all the resulting things).
19 文言:	
大哉乾乎！剛健中正，純粹精也。六爻發揮，旁通情也。「時乘六龍」、以「御天」也，「雲行雨施」、天下平也。君子以成德為行，日可見之行也。「潛」之為言也，隱而未見，行而未成，是以君子「弗用」也。
Qian:	
Qian, (thus) originating, is able with its admirable benefits to benefit all under the sky. We are not told how its benefits are conferred; but how great is (its operation)! How great is (what is emblemed by) Qian!--strong, vigorous, undeflected, correct, and (in all these qualities) pure, unmixed, exquisite! The six lines, as explained (by the duke of Zhou), bring forth and display (its meaning), and everything about it is (thus) indirectly exhibited. (The great man) at the proper time drives with these six dragons through the sky. The clouds move, and the rain is distributed; all under heaven enjoys repose. In the superior man his conduct is (the fruit of) his perfected virtue, which might be seen therefore in his daily course; but the force of that phrase, 'lying hid,' requires him to keep retired, and not yet show himself, nor proceed to the full development of his course. While this is the case, the superior man (knows that) it is not the time for active doing.
20 文言:	
君子學以聚之，問以辯之，寬以居之，仁以行之。《易》曰「見龍在田、利見大人」，君德也。
Qian:	
The superior man learns and accumulates the results of his learning; puts questions, and discriminates among those results; dwells magnanimously and unambitiously in what he has attained to; and carries it into practice with benevolence. What the Yi says, 'The dragon appears in the field:--it will be advantageous to meet with the great man,' has reference to the virtuous qualities of a ruler (as thus described).
21 文言:	
九三重剛而不中，上不在天，下不在田，故「乾乾」因其時而「惕」，雖危「无咎」矣。
Qian:	
In the third NINE, there is a twofold symbol of) strength, but (the position) is not central. (Its occupant) is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath. Therefore there must be active vigilance and cautious apprehension as the time requires; and. though (the position be) perilous, there will be no mistake.
22 文言:	
九四重剛而不中，上不在天，下不在田，中不在人，故「或」之。「或」之者、疑之也，故「无咎」。
Qian:	
In the fourth NINE, there is (the symbol of) strength, but (the position) is not central. (Its occupant) is not in heaven above, nor is he in the field beneath, nor is he in the place of man intermediate. Hence he is in perplexity; and being so, he has doubts about what. should be his movements, and so will give no occasion for blame.
23 文言:	
夫「大人」者、與天地合其德，與日月合其明，與四時合其序，與鬼神合其吉凶，先天而天弗違，後天而奉天時。天且弗違，而況於人乎？況於鬼神乎？
Qian:	
The great man is he who is in harmony, in his attributes, with heaven and earth; in his brightness, with the sun and moon; in his orderly procedure, with the four sea-sons; and in his relation to what is fortunate and what is calamitous, in harmony with the spirit-like operations (of Providence). He may precede Heaven, and Heaven will not act in opposition to him; he may follow Heaven, but will act (only) as Heaven at the time would do. If Heaven will not act in opposition to him, how much less will men! how much less will the spirit-like operation (of Providence)!
24 文言:	
「亢」之為言也，知進而不知退，知存而不知亡，知得而不知喪。其唯聖人乎！知進退存亡而不失其正者，其唯聖人乎！
Qian:	
The force of that phrase--'exceeding the proper limits'--indicates the knowing to advance but not to retire; to maintain but not to let perish to get but not to lose. He only is the sage who knows to advance and to retire, to maintain and to let perish; and that without ever acting incorrectly. Yes, he only is the sage!
1 ䷁坤:	
坤：元亨，利牝馬之貞。君子有攸往，先迷後得主，利西南得朋，東北喪朋。安貞，吉。
Kun:	
Kun (represents) what is great and originating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and having the firmness of a mare. When the superior man (here intended) has to make any movement, if he take the initiative, he will go astray; if he follow, he will find his (proper) lord. The advantageousness will be seen in his getting friends in the south-west, and losing friends in the north-east. If he rest in correctness and firmness, there will be good fortune.
彖傳:	
至哉坤元，萬物資生，乃順承天。坤厚載物，德合无疆。含弘光大，品物咸亨。牝馬地類，行地无疆，柔順利貞。君子攸行，先迷失道，後順得常。西南得朋，乃與類行；東北喪朋，乃終有慶。安貞之吉，應地无疆。
Tuan Zhuan:	
Complete is the 'great and originating (capacity)' indicated by Kun! All things owe to it their birth; - it receives obediently the influences of Heaven. Kun, in its largeness, supports and contains all things. Its excellent capacity matches the unlimited power (of Qian). Its comprehension is wide, and its brightness great. The various things obtain (by it) their full development. The mare is a creature of earthly kind. Its (power of) moving on the earth is without limit; it is mild and docile, advantageous and firm: - such is the course of the superior man. 'If he take the initiative, he goes astray:' - he misses, that is, his proper course. 'If he follow,' he is docile, and gets into his regular (course). 'In the south-west he will get friends:' - he will be walking with those of his own class. 'In the north-east he will lose friends:' - but in the end there will be ground for congratulation. 'The good fortune arising from resting in firmness' corresponds to the unlimited capacity of the earth.
象傳:	
地勢坤，君子以厚德載物。
Xiang Zhuan:	
The (capacity and sustaining) power of the earth is what is denoted by Kun. The superior man, in accordance with this, with his large virtue supports (men and) things.
2 ䷁坤:	
初六：履霜，堅冰至。
Kun:	
In the first SIX, divided, (we see its subject) treading on hoarfrost. The strong ice will come (by and by).
象傳:	
履霜堅冰，陰始凝也。馴致其道，至堅冰也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'He is treading on hoarfrost; - the strong ice will come (by and by):' - the cold (air) has begun to take form. Allow it to go on quietly according to its nature, and (the hoarfrost) will come to strong ice.
3 ䷁坤:	
六二：直，方，大，不習无不利。
Kun:	
The second SIX, divided, (shows the attribute of) being straight, square, and great. (Its operation), without repeated efforts, will be in every respect advantageous.
象傳:	
六二之動，直以方也。不習无不利，地道光也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
The movement indicated by the second six, (divided),is 'from the straight (line) to the square.' '(Its operation), without repeated effort, in every way advantageous,' shows the brilliant result of the way of earth.
4 ䷁坤:	
六三：含章可貞。或從王事，无成有終。
Kun:	
The third SIX, divided, (shows its subject) keeping his excellence under restraint, but firmly maintaining it. If he should have occasion to engage in the king's service, though he will not claim the success (for himself), he will bring affairs to a good issue.
象傳:	
含章可貞；以時發也。或從王事，知光大也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'He keeps his excellence tinder restraint, but firmly maintains it:' - at the proper time he will manifest it. 'He may have occasion to engage in the king's service: - great is the glory of his wisdom.
5 ䷁坤:	
六四：括囊；无咎，无譽。
Kun:	
The fourth SIX, divided, (shows the symbol of) a sack tied up. There will be no ground for blame or for praise.
象傳:	
括囊无咎，慎不害也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'A sack tied up; - there will be no error:' - this shows how, through carefulness, no injury will be received.
6 ䷁坤:	
六五：黃裳，元吉。
Kun:	
The fifth SIX, divided, (shows) the yellow lower garment. There will be great good fortune.
象傳:	
黃裳元吉，文在中也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
S. 'The Yellow lower-garment; - there will be great good fortune:' - this follows from that ornamental (colour's) being in the right and central place.
7 ䷁坤:	
上六：龍戰于野，其血玄黃。
Kun:	
The sixth SIX, divided (shows) dragons fighting in the wild. Their blood is purple and yellow.
象傳:	
戰龍於野，其道窮也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'The dragons fight in the wild: - the (onward) course (indicated by Kun) is pursued to extremity.
8 ䷁坤:	
用六：利永貞。
Kun:	
(The lines of this hexagram are all weak and divided, as appears from) the use of the number six. If those (who are thus represented) be perpetually correct and firm, advantage will arise.
象傳:	
用六永貞，以大終也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'(The lines are all weak and divided, as appears from) the use of the number SIX: - but (those who are thus represented) becoming perpetually correct and firm, there will thereby be a great consummation.
9 文言:	
《文言》曰：《坤》至柔而動也剛，至靜而德方，後得主而有常，含萬物而化光。坤道其順乎，承天而時行。
Kun:	
(What is indicated by) Kun is most gentle and weak, but, when put in motion, is hard and strong; it is most still, but is able to give every definite form. 'By following, it obtains its (proper) lord,' and pursues its regular (course). It contains all things in itself, and its transforming (power) is glorious. Yes, what docility marks the way of Kun! It receives the influences of heaven, and acts at the proper time.
10 文言:	
積善之家，必有餘慶；積不善之家，必有餘殃。臣弒其君，子弒其父，非一朝一夕之故，其所由來者漸矣，由辯之不早辯也。《易》曰「履霜、堅冰至」，蓋言順也。
Kun:	
The family that accumulates goodness is sure to have superabundant happiness, and the family that accumulates evil is sure to have superabundant misery. The murder of a ruler by his minister, or of his father by a son, is not the result of the events of one morning or one evening. The causes of it have gradually accumulated,--through the absence of early discrimination. The words of the Yi, 'He treads on the hoar-frost; the strong ice will come (by and by),' show the natural (issue and growth of things).
11 文言:	
「直」其正也，「方」其義也。君子敬以直內，義以方外，敬義立而德不孤。「直、方、大、不習无不利」，則不疑其所行也。
Kun:	
'Straight' indicates the correctness (of the internal principle), and 'square,' the righteousness (of the external act). The superior man, (thus represented), by his self-reverence maintains the inward (correctness), and in righteousness adjusts his external acts. His reverence and righteousness being (thus) established, his virtues are not solitary instances or of a single class. 'Straight, square, and great, working his operations, without repeated efforts, in every respect advantageous:'--this shows how (such a one) has no doubts as to what he does.
12 文言:	
陰雖有美「含」之以從王事，弗敢成也。地道也，妻道也，臣道也。地道「无成」而代「有終」也。天地變化，草木蕃。天地閉，賢人隱。《易》曰「括囊、无咎无譽」，蓋言謹也。
Kun:	
Although (the subject of) this divided line has excellent qualities, he (does not display them, but) keeps them under restraint. 'If he engage with them in the service of the king, and be successful, he will not claim that success for himself:'--this is the way of the earth, of a wife, of a minister. The way of the earth is-'not to claim the merit of achievement,' but on behalf (of heaven) to bring things to their proper issue. Through the changes and transformations produced by heaven and earth, plants and trees grow luxuriantly. If (the reciprocal influence of) heaven and earth were shut up and restrained, we should have (a state that might suggest to us) the case of men of virtue and ability lying in obscurity. The words of the Yi, 'A sack tied up:--there will be no ground for blame or for praise,' are in reality a lesson of caution.
13 文言:	
君子「黃」中通理，正位居體，美在其中而暢於四支，發於事業，美之至也。
Kun:	
The superior man (emblemed here) by the yellow and correct (colour), is possessed of comprehension and discrimination. He occupies the correct position (of supremacy), but (that emblem) is on (the lower part of) his person. His excellence is in the centre (of his being), but it diffuses a complacency over his four limbs, and is manifested in his (conduct of) affairs:--this is the perfection of excellence.
14 文言:	
陰疑於陽必「戰」，為其嫌於无陽也，故稱「龍」焉。猶未離其類也，故稱「血」焉。夫「玄黃」者、天地之雜也。天玄而地黃。
Kun:	
(The subject of) the yin (or divided line) thinking himself equal to the (subject of the) yang, or undivided line, there is sure to be 'a contest.' As if indignant at there being no acknowledgment of the (superiority of the subject of the) yang line, (the text) uses the term 'dragons.' But still the (subject of neither line) can leave his class, and hence we have 'the blood' mentioned. The mention of that as being (both) 'azure and yellow' indicates the mixture of heaven and earth. Heaven's (colour) is azure and earth's is yellow.
1 ䷂屯:	
屯：元亨，利貞，勿用有攸往，利建侯。
Zhun:	
Zhun (indicates that in the case which it presupposes) there will be great progress and success, and the advantage will come from being correct and firm. (But) any movement in advance should not be (lightly) undertaken. There will be advantage in appointing feudal princes.
彖傳:	
屯，剛柔始交而難生，動乎險中，大亨貞。雷雨之動滿盈，天造草昧，宜建侯而不寧。
Tuan Zhuan:	
In Zhun we have the strong (Qian) and the weak (Kun) commencing their intercourse, and difficulties arising. Movement in the midst of peril gives rise to 'great progress and success, (through) firm correctness.' By the action of the thunder and rain, (which are symbols of Kan and Zhen), all (between heaven and earth) is filled up. But the condition of the time is full of irregularity and obscurity. Feudal princes should be established, but the feeling that rest and peace have been secured should not be indulged (even then).
象傳:	
雲，雷，屯；君子以經綸。
Xiang Zhuan:	
(The trigram representing) clouds and (that representing) thunder form Zhun. The superior man, in accordance with this, (adjusts his measures of government) as in sorting the threads of the warp and woof.
2 ䷂屯:	
初九：磐桓；利居貞，利建侯。
Zhun:	
The first NINE, undivided, shows the difficulty (its subject has) in advancing. It will be advantageous for him to abide correct and firm; advantageous (also) to be made a feudal ruler.
象傳:	
雖磐桓，志行正也。以貴下賤，大得民也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
Although 'there is a difficulty in advancing,' the mind (of the subject of the line) is set on doing what is correct. While noble, he humbles himself to the mean, and grandly gains the people.
3 ䷂屯:	
六二：屯如邅如，乘馬班如。匪寇婚媾，女子貞不字，十年乃字。
Zhun:	
The second SIX, divided, shows (its subject) distressed and obliged to return; (even) the horses of her chariot (also) seem to be retreating. (But) not by a spoiler (is she assailed), but by one who seeks her to be his wife. The young lady maintains her firm correctness, and declines a union. After ten years she will be united, and have children.

Tuan Zhuan:	
In Jia Ren the wife has her correct place in the inner (trigram), and the man his correct place in the outer. That man and woman occupy their correct places is the great righteousness shown (in the relation and positions of) heaven and earth. In Jia Ren we have the idea of an authoritative ruler; - that, namely, represented by the parental authority. Let the father be indeed father, and the son son; let the elder brother be indeed elder brother, and the younger brother younger brother, let the husband be indeed husband, and the wife wife: - then will the family be in its normal state. Bring the family to that state, and all under heaven will be established.

Jia Ren:	
The third NINE, undivided, shows its subject (treating) the members of the household with stern severity.

象傳:	
家人嗃嗃，未失也；婦子嘻嘻，失家節也。

When 'the members of the household are treated with stern severity,' there has been no (great) failure (in the regulation of the family). When 'wife and children are smirking and chattering,' the (proper) economy of the family has been lost.

彖傳:	
睽，火動而上，澤動而下；二女同居，其志不同行；說而麗乎明，柔進而上行，得中而應乎剛；是以小事吉。天地睽，而其事同也；男女睽，而其志通也；萬物睽，而其事類也；睽之時用大矣哉！
Tuan Zhuan:	
In Kui we have (the symbol of) Fire, which, when moved, tends upwards, and that of a Marsh, whose waters, when moved, tend downwards. We have (also the symbols of) two sisters living together, but whose wills do not move in the same direction. (We see how the inner trigram expressive of) harmonious satisfaction is attached to (the outer expressive of) bright intelligence; (we see) the weak line advanced and acting above, and how it occupies the central place, and is responded to by the strong (line below). These indications show that 'in small matters there will (still) be good fortune.' Heaven and earth are separate and apart, but the work which they do is the same. Male and female are separate and apart, but with a common will they seek the same object. There is diversity between the myriad classes of beings, but there is an analogy between their several operations. Great indeed are the phenomena and the results of this condition of disunion and separation.
象傳:	
上火下澤，睽；君子以同而異。
Xiang Zhuan:	
(The trigram representing) fire above, and that for (the waters of) a marsh below, form Kui. The superior man, in accordance with this, where there is a general agreement, yet admits diversity.

象傳:	
厥宗噬膚，往有慶也。
Xiang Zhuan:	
'With his hereditary minister (he unites closely and easily) as if he were biting through a piece of skin:' - his going forward will afford ground for congratulation.

上九：睽孤，見豕負塗，載鬼一車，先張之弧，後說之弧，匪寇婚媾，往遇雨則吉。
Kui:	
The topmost NINE, undivided, shows its subject solitary amidst the (prevailing) disunion.

彖傳:	
蹇，難也，險在前也。見險而能止，知矣哉！蹇利西南，往得中也；不利東北，其道窮也。利見大人，往有功也。當位貞吉，以正邦也。蹇之時用大矣哉！
Tuan Zhuan:	
Jian denotes difficulty. There is (the trigram expressive of) perilousness in front. When one, seeing the peril, can arrest his steps (in accordance with the significance of the lower tri. gram), is he not wise? (The language of) Jian, that 'advantage will be found in the south-west,' refers to the (strong fifth line) advanced and in the central place. That 'there will be no advantage in the north-east,' intimates that the way (of dealing with the Jian state) is exhausted. That 'it will be advantageous to see the great man,' intimates that advance will lead to achievement. That the places (of the different lines after the first) are those appropriate to them indicates firm correctness and good fortune, with which the regions (of the kingdom) are brought to their normal state. Great indeed is the work to be done in the time of Jian!
象傳:	
山上有水，蹇；君子以反身修德。

解，險以動，動而免乎險，解。解利西南，往得眾也。其來復吉，乃得中也。有攸往夙吉，往有功也。天地解，而雷雨作，雷雨作，而百果草木皆甲坼，解之時大矣哉！

'In (the state indicated by) Jie, advantage will be found in the south-west:' - the movement (thus) intimated will win all. That 'there will be good fortune in coming back (to the old conditions)' shows that such action is that of the due medium. That 'if some operations be necessary, there will be good fortune in the early conducting of them' shows that such operations will be successful. When heaven and earth are freed (from the grasp of winter), we have thunder and rain. When these come, the buds of the plants and trees that produce the various fruits begin to burst. Great indeed are the phenomena in the time intimated by Jie.
象傳:	
雷雨作，解；君子以赦過宥罪。
Xiang Zhuan:

What descends from above reaches to all below, so great and brilliant is the course (of its operation). That 'there will be advantage in every movement which shall be undertaken' appears from the central and correct (positions of the second and fifth lines), and the (general) blessing (the dispensing of which they imply). That 'it will be advantageous (even) to cross the great stream' appears from the action of wood (shown in the figure).
